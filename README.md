## The Story of Vegucation

Technology has been revolutionary in the classroom, and laptops have facilitated incredible new learning experiences for children across the country and the globe. However, the distraction caused by use of computers during class has also served to distract students from their studies.

Our team set out to solve this problem using the most powerful and time-tested tools, **punishment** and **fear**. As broccoli is known to strike terror into the hearts of children everywhere, our team created a chrome extension that, when a student visits a website detrimental to his or her education, replaces every image with an **image of broccoli**, and replaces every word with **the word broccoli**. 

## FAQ

#### What websites are unblocked by Vegucation?

We hand-selected 3 websites that the data we made up suggests are most conducive to a student's success for our whitelist. They are as follows:

* **Khan Academy**, to supplement curriculae with educational videos that enhance subjects learned in class
* **Wikipedia**, so students have access to all the world's knowledge and misinformation at their fingertips
* **Common App**, because it's never too early to start thinking about applying to college

#### Can educators change the whitelist to better fit their classroom needs?

We have disabled modification of the whitelist, so as to ensure children across the country recieve similar levels of education, and that no child gets left behind.

#### Does Vegucation work on Youtube?

Yes

#### My child likes broccoli! Will Vegucation still scare my child away from harmful websites?

While your child may lead a healthier lifestyle, unfortunately Vegucation will not work for her, and she likely will fall behind in her studies. The blame's on you for this one.
